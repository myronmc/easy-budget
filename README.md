===========
AngularJS is described as a general purpose framework, that shines when used to write CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) type web applications**.  

The primary purpose of this mockup is to demonstrate understanding and utility of this CRUD functionality along with a few other Angular features.  

The UI was previously used for my Graduate Studies final project for the class: Human Computers and Cognition. The previous demo used jQuery based DOM manipulation.
